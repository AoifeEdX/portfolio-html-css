# Portfolio in HTML & CSS only

## Description

This responsive portfolio built in HTML and CSS demonstrates what I learned from Modules 1 & 2 of the edX Skills Boot Camp in Front-End Web Development. It also includes some features I wanted to test out, such as hover effects and a hamburger menu for mobile screens.

### Features:
* The page presents my GitHub username, an avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of five websites/applications; the majority are currently placeholders until I produce more applications as the course progresses.
* When presented with my first application then that application's image is larger than the others.
* When images of the websites/applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application; again, mostly placeholders to existing websites at the moment.
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to the user's viewport.

## Usage

This portfolio is used as a starting point to represent my work, which I will add to as the course progresses.
